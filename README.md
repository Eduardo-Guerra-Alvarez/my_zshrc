# my_zshrc
First, I use:
- iterm
- zsh
- Oh-my-zsh
- porwerline 10k

## How configurate iterm?
I searched and download the theme [Ayu](https://github.com/hwyncho/ayu-iTerm) and I configurate my iterm

After that I install zsh because I like more than bash, I install zsh with ```brew install zsh``` and ```sudo chsh -s $(which zsh)``` but 
now, Mac has install zsh

## Install Oh-my-zsh
If you want to use correct zsh, you need [Oh-my-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) this is a framework for you zsh
You need to run this command and you will get this framework
``` 	
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Install Powerline 10k
Powerline 10k is a line very beautiful, but the configuration is a little large
You can visit your repository [power10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

And I recomender install the font MesloLGS NF with this fond I can look all icons

Plus, you may want some plugins and you can check in my .zshrc these are my plugins and my alias for diferents commands
